#### 1. Describe what is the primary problem you try to solve? 
Ans: The primary problem I'm trying to solve is how to determine whether a credit card is valid or not by comparing it to the various credit card types, such as Mastercard, Visa, American Express, and Discover, and using the credit card number to find the card issuer and the appropriate objects based on the type of card.
 

#### 2. Describe what are the secondary problems you try to solve (if there are any)?
Ans: Determining the appropriate design patterns to take into account is the secondary issue. Future additions of new credit classes for various credit card types.
 
#### 3. Describe what design pattern(s) you use (use plain text and diagrams)?
Ans: Design Patterns: Chain of Responsibility, Strategy
 
#### Strategy Design Pattern:
 
The Strategy Design Pattern enables dynamic behavior changes in an application based on a selected strategy. It allows for the creation of objects and strategies specific to different file types, adapting the application's behavior accordingly.
 
I implemented  Strategy Design Pattern to support multiple file formats in my application. I designed three interfaces - Reader, Writer, and CreditCardHandler - to handle different aspects of file processing and credit card handling.

The Reader interface provides a common contract for classes that can read input files, and it includes a readFile method to handle the reading process based on the input file type.

The CreditCardHandler interface defines a common structure for classes responsible for checking the credit card type of parsed input files. It includes a checkCreditType method that takes the parsed input file and determines if it belongs to any specific credit card type category.

The Writer interface provides a common structure for classes responsible for writing data to different file formats. It includes a writeToFile method that takes an input of type OutputEntry (which represents the final output format) and writes the data to the expected file format.
 
This design pattern enables runtime behavior swapping and follows the Open/Closed principle. It allows for the introduction of new strategies without affecting the client code, making it easy to accommodate new file formats without disrupting the existing code or design.
 
#### Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern:
 
After parsing an XML, JSON, or CSV file, we need to validate its content to determine the credit card type among the four available types.
 
We can utilize the Chain of Responsibility design pattern to validate the file against different credit card handlers. The validation process starts with the MasterCard handler. If the file does not match the criteria for MasterCard, it is passed on to the next credit card handler in the chain. This allows for flexible and extensible validation of the file against multiple credit card types.

To facilitate the overall process, we introduce a main credit card handler that acts as a mediator. This handler receives the file and passes it to each individual credit card handler for validation. Each credit card handler implements the main handler and performs the necessary checks specific to its credit card type. This approach enables a centralized and organized validation process, allowing each handler to focus on its designated credit card type.
 
#### 4. Describe the consequences of using this/these pattern(s)?
 
##### Chain of Responsibility
 
###### Advantages:
 
-> Decouples the sender of a request from its recipients.
 
-> The client is unaware of the chain structure and interacts with the chain through direct method calls.
 
-> The order of the chain can be easily modified or adjusted, and new handlers can be added or existing ones can be removed as needed.
 
###### Disadvantages:
 
-> Debugging and observing the runtime characteristics of the chain can be challenging due to the dynamic nature of the pattern.
-> If the chain is not properly configured or there are gaps in the chain, it may lead to requests being ignored or not processed correctly.
 
#### Strategy Design Pattern: 
 
###### Advantages:
 
-> The Strategy design pattern provides flexibility in adding new strategies as needed without impacting existing code.

-> It promotes code reusability. By encapsulating specific algorithms or behaviors into separate strategies, these strategies can be reused across different parts of the application. This eliminates the need for duplicating code or implementing similar logic multiple times, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
 
###### Disadvantages:
 
-> Users of the Strategy design pattern should be aware of multiple strategies and understand the distinctions between them.
 
-> Having a large number of objects at the same time can become cumbersome and redundant in the Strategy design pattern.
